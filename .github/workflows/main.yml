# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
# This scans the Riches Application Release on FOD known as https://ams.fortify.com/Applications/118594

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build" where it both builds the code and then delivers the packaged code to FOD for a security scan.
